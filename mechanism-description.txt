Mechanism: The mechanism we used to for checking for causal history is from
using the causal dependency list

To detect a replica is down we set a timeout for 2 seconds if the replica does
not respond we assume it is down and change the view.

To assign members to shards we have a helper function called assignShards, as
long as its passed the same view and shard count it will generate the same 
mapping of nodes to shards. This allows each node to generate a complete shard
membership list that is consistent with the others as long as shard count
and view are consistent.

The resharding mechanism first checks if the shard count is valid for the number 
of nodes in the view, it then generates a new shard members list using the 
assignShards function based on the new shard count. It then gets the state 
from each node in the view but only saves the keys that belong to it's new
shard assignment.
